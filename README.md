# ETL Project - E-commerce Dataset

This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project focused on processing an E-commerce dataset. The goal of this project is to extract data from various sources, perform transformations to ensure data quality and consistency, and load the transformed data into a target database for further analysis and reporting.

## Dataset

The E-commerce dataset used in this project consists of customer information, product details, order history, and transactional data. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is located in the `data` directory. It includes the following files:

- `user_dataset.csv`: Contains information about customers, such as customer ID, name, email, and address.
- `products_dataset.csv`: Includes details about the products sold, such as product ID, name, price, and category.
- `order_item_dataset.csv`: Contains order information, including order ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and order date.
- `order_dataset.csv`: Contains more information about orders.
- `seller_dataset.csv`: Contains information about seller, such as seller ID, name, email, and address.
- `payment_dataset.csv`:contains payment method for orders.
- `feedback_dataset.csv`:contains feedbacks of users.

## ETL Process

The ETL process for this project follows the standard flow of Extract, Transform, and Load:

1. Extraction:
   - The data is extracted from the provided CSV files using a Python script.
   - The script reads the CSV files and loads the data into memory for further processing.

2. Transformation:
   - Data transformation is performed to ensure data quality and consistency.
   - The script applies cleaning operations, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and validating data integrity.
   - It also performs data type conversions, standardization, and enrichment based on predefined rules and business requirements.
   - Transformation steps may also include data aggregation, joining multiple datasets, or creating derived fields.

3. Load:
   - The transformed data is loaded into a target database for storage and analysis.
   - In this project, we use a SQL server database as the target database.
   - The script establishes a connection to the database and creates the necessary tables to store the transformed data.
   - Finally, it inserts the transformed data into the corresponding tables in the database.


## Future Enhancements

This ETL project can be extended and enhanced in several ways:

- Implementing incremental data extraction to handle new data updates efficiently.
- Adding data validation checks and error handling mechanisms.
- Automating the ETL process to run periodically or triggered by specific events.
- Integrating with data visualization tools for generating reports and dashboards.
- Exploring advanced data transformations and analytics on the E-commerce dataset.
